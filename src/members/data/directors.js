        bio: '<p>My wife and I moved to Adora Trails from Tucson in 2014 to be closer to our kids and grandkids.  I have been a CPA in public practice since I graduated from college in 1970.  I sold my accounting practice in 2014 and worked for the buyer until 2019 when I became fully retired.  We were attracted to Gilbert and Adora Trails because of the proximity to our kids and grandkids that live in this area as well as the amenities and developed common areas in this community.  I was elected to serve on the original Adora Trails HOA board for a term of two years beginning in 2020.  The developer Taylor Morrison turned over control of the HOA to the homeowners after they sold the remaining two lots in December 2019. Having just completed my two year term I am seeking election at this time to my second term.  I was elected by the HOA Board to serve as Treasurer of the association.  In my role as Treasurer I have worked directly with the accounting department of our management company in an oversight capacity.  Each month I receive a copy of the Adora Trails financial statements along with various records and reports.  I compare the bank statements against the balances in our financial statements as well as the accuracy of our various bank reconciliations.  The actual accounting records for the HOA are prepared and maintained by our management company AAM.  Digital copies of the association accounting records are provided to the Association board members.  In addition to monthly oversight I have also been directly involved in assisting our manager with the annual budget and the cash management our Association reserve funds.  I have also spent time reviewing the results of the onsight reserve study which was conducted in 2021 by an outside professional firm to assess our future funding needs for repairs and major equipment replacement costs.  The results of this study are used by the Association to determine our annual cash transfer to the reserve fund.  I believe that what I have learned about HOA operations and accounting the past two years in addition to my career as a CPA has qualified me to continue serving the homeowners for a second term.  Your support is greatly appreciated.</p>',

I have served as the Vice President of the HOA Board for the last two years. If elected, I will continue serve the community to the best of my ability. I will think through every decision I make to ensure that we maintain our property values, while keeping the community aesthetically pleasing and ensuring we keep the quality of life we have grown used to.</p>',

        bio: '<p>My wife, Sue, and I along with our dogs Lucy and Skippy moved to Adora Trails about three years ago. We chose Adora Trails because for its family feeling, the amenities, and the parklike setting of green areas and walking trails. We are delighted with our decision. Before relocating to Arizona, I served for 15 years on my town’s 7-member Board of Education as a Trustee, Vice President, and President and oversaw a $100 million dollar budget. Working collaboratively with my fellow board members, we improved the education the children received while being fiscally responsible to the taxpayers. To be more knowledgeable about being a Director on the HOA, I served on the Adora Trails Transition Education Committee and learned about our HOAs finances, budget, insurance, CC&Rs, rules, and bylaws. I would like to utilize my training and 15 years of experience working on a board that is like Adora Trails HOA to help maintain the beauty and safety of the community while being fiscally responsible to the community members.</p>',

While living in this wonderful community, we have been blessed with our 2 children, Zoe and Ozzy. We also stay busy with our 2 dogs, Arya and Oakley. For the past 16 years I have worked in the Oil and Gas sector focusing on Integrity Management. During my career, I have successfully managed prospects valued S100MM+. All with their own challenges and in an extremely remote and unforgiving environment where a lot of times you must work with what you have.  Additionally, I am an Arizona Small Business Owner and one of the Founders of the Adora Trails Cars and Coffee group.  One of my visions is that the HOA is the face of the Adora Trails community. It should reflect resident expected qualities of openness, empathy, accuracy in concert with established rules and regulations while being flexible, unbiased and honest in all decisions it makes for the community.</p>',
