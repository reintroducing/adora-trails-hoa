Additionally, I am an Arizona Small Business Owner and one of the Founders of the Adora Trails Cars and Coffee group.  One of my visions is that the HOA is the face of the Adora Trails community. It should reflect resident expected qualities of openness, empathy, accuracy in concert with established rules and regulations while being flexible, unbiased and honest in all decisions it makes for the community.</p>',
